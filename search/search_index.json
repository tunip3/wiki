Contact an admin on the Discord server and explain your motivation and expertise to get authorized with your github account or simply send pull requests to https://github.com/XboxOneResearch/wiki What's different between Dev Mode and Retail? The bootslot is determined based on whether or not your console was started in Developer Mode or Retail which will set the target the bootslot for booting up. Initially there was two slots known as Bootslot \"A\" and \"B\" - with recent updates it appears that a third slot has been added known as Bootslot \"C\" , which purpose is actually unknown. Dev Mode is mostly seperated from Retail mode. The windows registry is built up dynamically for each mode, SystemOS partition (system.xvd) is mounted ReadOnly and settings is seperated into settings.xvd and settings-devkit.xvd. It is important to note that developer mode and retail share very little to none in regards to its operating system files. It is configured at the lowest level which determines what your console can and cannot do. OS sandboxes As the console is built with security in mind, the OS layers are seperated in sandboxes. The system used is known as ''Hydra'' and is supposed to be based on HyperV - with 80% of code written specifically for the use on the Xbox One gaming console. The base operating system is HostOS, which runs drivers to interact with the hardware and communicate with other OS layers to exchange data / commands. SystemOS or ExclusiveOS/EraOS are preparing data to render and interact with the user. Is there telemetry being sent? YES! Basically every single thing is logged and transmitted to telemetry servers. In Dev Mode it appears to be possible to deactivate those services manually, The telemetry data that they send in developer mode will be more intense than retail, due to the nature of capturing as much data in regards to the tool usage. However, being in a preview program will also increase the data being sent. When can I mod games? Not a target of this project! While this is not in our own priorities, this is will be subject to a future console exploit. How does the guest virtual machines communicate with the Host? Named pipes / special kernel broker drivers are used to push data between the OS layers. ... The Xbox One is known to currently use a driver common on all OS VMs known as \"XVIO\" which appear to use shared memory ring buffers to communicate between the host and guest virtual machines. Can we draw standard Win32 UI? The possibility of \"escaping\" the UWP sandbox thats originally targeted at homebrew developers is tempting and of course delivers a bigger potential for developers to port applications more easily. However, as the rendering is done in a non-Win32-conform way, it is also a challenge to achieve displaying such Win32 GUI application. See XboxUI for further info. The current Shell UI that is used on the console disables the standard features we see on desktop-based Windows applications, with the Window Chrome that contains the title, minimize, maximize and close buttons. Where and how do we get the keys? Getting the keys to the kingdom is a topic that requires much more information and skills. The Xbox One uses the AMD Platform Security Processor (aka PSP), which appears to be designed specifically for Xbox based security and other features, which initialises the boot chain and stores the key(s) in the fuses. However, it also appears that there might be certain content keys stored in the System Kernel Memory and also Host Kernel Memory but this is hard to determine without comprehensive tools. Keys are are stored in '\"keyslots\" and are loaded depending on the bootslot / bootmode - this means booting to developer mode just loads the developer keyslot - retails keys wont be loaded and are not accessible for decryption. There are at least two keyslots as far as we know. - Retail (Green) - Development (Red) Different keys are used for the following purposes: - Bootloader encryption - Operating system container encryption (ODK / Offline distribution keys) - Games / apps (CIK / Content integrity keys) Certificates There are at least two major certificates utilized for generic usage: Console certificate and Boot capability certificate. Of course they are signed with an RSA key and therefore cannot be modified. For further info see Certificates . Reset Glitch hack? A power glitch hack that made hacking the Xbox 360 feasible for the public was an unforseen technique that led to breaking the secure boot chain of trust Info You could say that the designers of the console, that appeared in the end of 2005, were not aware of this possibility. Obviously technique and mitigations evolved since that time, so it is a lot harder to pull off such an attack on the modern Xbox One console. It is expected to have a lot of mitigations implemented (for example: timing checks, excessive data validity checks etc.) There was an Edge exploit - Why did nothing come out of it?

The windows registry is built up dynamically for each mode, SystemOS partition (system.xvd) is mounted ReadOnly and settings is seperated into settings.xvd and settings-devkit.xvd.

However, it also appears that there might be certain content keys stored in the System Kernel Memory and also Host Kernel Memory but this is hard to determine without comprehensive tools. Keys are are stored in '\"keyslots\" and are loaded depending on the bootslot / bootmode - this means booting to developer mode just loads the developer keyslot - retails keys wont be loaded and are not accessible for decryption.

The Windows Runtime is an API based on COM that allows interfacing from multiple programming languages and can be instanced from other services that register class objects. These are usually stored in the '.winmd' format that defines the information for each object within. The Xbox One makes great use of both WinRT and COM but it primarily uses the WinRT for the inbox applications (e.g. Dashboard) while store apps are not able to use them officially. Using the Xbox Windows Runtime We can utilise the runtime for the Xbox One by directly referencing the Windows.Xbox.winmd that is located on the system boot drive (C:\\Windows\\System32\\WinMetadata) in our Windows Runtime Library (C++). This will allow you to wrap around functionality natively and expose it to your application if it is written in another language such as C#. You can also extract more explicit information for manual use in a command line project with the utilities in the Windows SDK. Extracting header and idl files Open the Developer Command Prompt and navigate to the dumped directory of the consoles \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WinMetadata\" location.

XVD packages are a secured file format used by the Xbox One to store data, similar to the Xbox 360's STFS packages. XVD files are usually used to store system images/data while XVCs (a slightly modified version of XVDs) are used to store game data. An XVD file consists of a header containing the hash of the top level hash table, certain metadata about the file (such as content ID, content type, the sandbox ID the package was created for, the product ID that the package belongs to, etc) and also a signature of the header itself which is stored at the beginning of the XVD file, from 0h to 200h. After the header there's space for an optional embedded XVD (which is usually the GameOS partition that the game inside the XVC is coded against). This embedded XVD is just a copy-paste of the XVD being embedded with no changes made to it. After the embedded XVD comes an (optional) area for the hash tree, the tree is a multilevel array of hashes, with the topmost levels containing the hashes of the blocks in the levels underneath it. At the lowest level of the tree hashes of the data blocks (the blocks following the hash tree) are made. The hashes in the hash tree are computed using SHA-256, with the result usually being resized to 18h bytes (but for data block hashes can be slightly modified depending on flags in the XVD header and the XVC region that the data being hashed is located). The full 256-bit hash of the top-most level is stored in the XVD header. Following the hash tree is another optional area reserved for user data (also known as Persistent Local Storage). This area is for games to store local-only data, although some system XVD packages seem to store data here too. Finally after the user data comes the actual XVD data. If the XVD file is an XVC the first 3 blocks are reserved for an XVC descriptor (which is never encrypted). This specifies the content ID, any encryption keys used, the chunks used to update packages (if the XVC is using chunk-based updates) and offsets/lengths/keyIDs of the different XVC regions in the file, along with other metadata. XVC regions can be encrypted with any of the keys specified in the XVC descriptor. The region-based encryption also includes the XVC region ID as part of the AES-XTS IV/counter (known as data unit number for AES-XTS). Then comes the actual filesystem data. This data is encrypted with the CIK (can either be the decrypted value of the encrypted CIK in the XVD header if it's an XVD, or the key corresponding to the XVC key GUID) The filesystem data is just a normal NTFS filesystem containing the files inside the package, other filesystems may be possible but NTFS is the only one observed so far. Security Overview From a security standpoint XVDs seem very secure: Each block of data is hashed, with the hash stored in the bottom-most hash tree level Each block in that hash tree level is then hashed with the hash result stored in the level above it This continues, until eventually the number of hashes in the level can fit into one hash block That hash block is then hashed with the result stored in the XVD header The XVD header is then hashed, and the hash signed with Microsoft's private key, the signature is then stored at the beginning of the file. To make sure the package is authenticated by Microsoft and not tampered with the console just needs to verify the signature of the header-hash, verify the top-most hash tree hash and then verify that each hash in the hash tree matches up with the actual hash. This is similar to the way STFS packages were secured on the Xbox 360, however instead of having the hash tables scattered around the file (as with STFS) they're instead stored before the data actually begins. The data blocks inside XVD files are also secured with AES-XTS encryption (the encrypted data is then used for the hashes), with XVC packages the Xbox One either retrieves the encryption key over Xbox Live or retrieves it from the game disc, however it seems that the keys from these methods don't work as CIK keys. It's assumed that these keys are obfuscated/encrypted in some way (possibly with the retail ODK in the same way that the encrypted CIK in non-XVC files is encrypted?) Non-XVC files use an ODK which appears to be static for all XVDs (but differs between retail/devkits ?), this key is used to decrypt the encrypted CIK in the XVD header, the decrypted CIK is then used to decrypt the XVD data. Acronyms CIK: Content Instance Key, used to encrypt the XVD data, is either stored encrypted in the header or stored outside the package in a license file ODK: Offline Distribution Key, used to decrypt the header's encrypted CIK, and likely any CIK stored outside the package Tools xvdtool by emoose References XVD info by emoose on github AES-XTS on wikipedia","title":"Xbox virtual drive"},{"location":"xbox-virtual-drive/#xbox-virtual-drive","text":"","title":"Xbox Virtual Drive"},{"location":"xbox-virtual-drive/#what-are-xvds","text":"XVD packages are a secured file format used by the Xbox One to store data, similar to the Xbox 360's STFS packages.

For detailed descriptions of the former, see Windows Device Portal overview . The following sections describe the pages that are unique to the Xbox Device Portal. Home Similar to the Windows Device Portal's Apps manager page, the Xbox Device Portal's Home page displays a list of installed games and apps under My games & apps . You can click on the name of a game or app to see more details about it, such as the Package family name . In the Actions drop down, you can take action on the game or app, such as Launch it. Under Xbox Live test accounts , you can manage the accounts associated with your Xbox. You can add users and guest accounts, create new users, sign users in and out, and remove accounts. Xbox Live (Game saves) Both the Windows Device Portal and the Xbox Device Portal have an Xbox Live page. However, the Xbox Device Portal has a unique section, Xbox Live game saves , where you can save data for games installed on your Xbox. Enter the Service Configuration ID (SCID) (see Xbox Live service configuration for more information), Membername (MSA) , and Package Family Name (PFN) associated with the title and game save, browse for the Input File (.json or .xml) , and then select one of the buttons ( Reset , Import , Export , and Delete ) to manipulate the save data. In the Generate section, you can generate dummy data and save to the specified input file. Simply enter the Containers (default 2) , Blobs (default 3) , and Blob Size (default 1024) , and select Generate . HTTP monitor The HTTP Monitor allows you to view decrypted HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your app or game when it's running on your Xbox One. To enable it, open Dev Home on your Xbox One, go to the Settings tab, and in the HTTP Monitor Settings box, check Enable HTTP Monitor . Once enabled, in the Xbox Device Portal, you can Stop , Clear , and Save to file HTTP and HTTPS traffic by selecting the respective buttons. Network (Fiddler tracing) The Network page in the Xbox Device Portal is almost identical to the Networking page in the Windows Device Portal, with the exception of Fiddler tracing , which is unique to the Xbox Device Portal. This allows you to run Fiddler on your PC to log and inspect HTTP and HTTPS traffic between your Xbox One and the internet. See How to use Fiddler with Xbox One when developing for UWP for more information. Media capture On the Media capture page, you can select Capture Screenshot to take a screenshot of your Xbox One. Once you do, your browser will prompt you to download the file. You can check Prefer HDR if you want to take the screenshot in HDR (if the console supports it). Settings On the Settings page, you can view and edit several settings for your Xbox One. At the top, you can select Import to import settings from a file and Export to export the current settings to a .txt file. Importing settings can make bulk editing easier, especially when configuring multiple consoles. To create a settings file to import, change the settings to how you want them to be, and then export the settings. Then you can use this file to import settings quickly and easily for other consoles. There are several sections with different settings to view and/or edit, which are explained below. Device Information Device name : The name of the device.
